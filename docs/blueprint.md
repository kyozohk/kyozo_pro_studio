## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Purple (#A020F0) for buttons and accents to match the creative and immersive experience described in the overview.  The feeling of the color will align with creativity and cultural evolution.
- Background color: Black (#000000) with subtle dark gradients to enhance the dark-themed modern UI and overall dark mode only layout, aiming for a non-glaring screen experience.
- Accent color: Blue (#00BFFF), an analogous color to purple to create contrast. Use the accent for borders and gradients.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a contemporary, precise feel, well-suited for headings.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring readability and a modern look, if longer text is required. 'Inter' (sans-serif) would also be appropriate as a single font app-wide.
- Use a set of modern, minimalist icons to match the platform's modern UI. Make these scalable.
- Design the layout to be responsive and mobile-first, utilizing grids for tags and events. Incorporate rounded elements and cards with a shadow effect for depth.
